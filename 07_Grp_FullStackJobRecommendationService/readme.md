# RozGAAR 

**RozGAAR** is a common platform for daily-wage workers (like painters, gardeners etc) and their recruiters to connect in order to
increase their employability during global pandemic crises.

It has an easy to understand one click login system where the daily wage workers need not to remember their username or password. Be a worker or a recruiter, we got you covered. 

As Worker, You can 

* Create your profile with your job preferences.
* Find the perfect job that you require from the job posted by our registered recruiters.
* Filter your jobs according to your preferences and contact the recruiter.

As Recruiter, You can 
* Look for the worker you need from your dashboard.
* Create job openings on which a worker can contact you.
* Filter worker profiles according to your needs.
* Refer other workers who do not have proper internet connection.
