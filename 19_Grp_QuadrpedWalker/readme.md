# Training a Quadruped Walker
To train custom-build Quadruped Walker through various reinforcement learning algorithms. The walker agent is incentivized to navigate towards a target while being restricted to two or three degrees of freedom along each of its limbs.
To clarify more, we are training a bot in a virtual environment to adapt and react to the obstacles met in that environment.
